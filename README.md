# YourCareer

## **Creation:**  
When starting your career, you’ll create your player with the following options: first name, last name, jersey number, college, hometown, height, weight, wingspan, caliber, specialty, and personality traits.  
- *Playstyle Selection*: Choose a playstyle like slasher, sharpshooter, defensive anchor, or all-around. This will affect your gameplay tendencies and progression.  
- *Caliber & Potential*: Along with caliber (low, mid, high), you’ll be assigned a "Potential" rating, which will determine your maximum skill growth. High-caliber players start stronger but may have lower growth ceilings, while lower-caliber players can grow significantly over time.  
- *Personality Traits*: Define your player's personality, which impacts coach relations, endorsement deals, and fan engagement. Examples include "Humble," "Showman," or "Team Leader."

## **Draft:**  
Your draft position depends on the caliber and performance during pre-draft activities.  
- *Pre-Draft Process*: Participate in interviews, team workouts, and combines to influence your draft stock. Exceptional performances may raise your draft position, while poor results may drop it.  
- *Draft Day*: Experience the excitement of draft day with real-time updates and possible trades. Your draft number will be assigned, showing which team selects you and the reactions from fans and analysts.

## **Lineup:**  
Your starting role depends on the caliber you selected.  
- *Starter or Bench*: High-caliber players are likely to start, while lower-caliber players may begin on the bench.  
- *Dynamic Roles*: Your role on the team can change throughout the season. Performance, training, and events can all influence whether you rise or fall in the lineup.

## **Battles:**  
If you start as a bench player, you will need to earn the coach's trust to move up to starter status.  
- *Earning Trust*: Trust is earned through strong performances, achieving accolades, upgrading skills, and completing quests. Trust is relative to the starter’s overall rating, and the higher their rating, the more trust you’ll need.  
- *Battle System*: Engage in "Battles" with starters to challenge them for their spot. Consistently outperforming the starter in practices or games will move you closer to the starting five.

## **Trust:**  
Coach trust is a key factor in determining your role on the team.  
- *Specialty Focus*: Your trust increases significantly when you excel in your chosen specialty (e.g., 3-point shooting, defense).  
- *Trust Gauge*: Track your trust level with a visual meter, which shows how close you are to becoming a starter. Trust also rises with accolades, performance, and consistent training.

## **Training:**  
There are no limitations on what you can train, but specialties are cheaper to upgrade.  
- *Dynamic Training Costs*: Training within your specialty costs less experience points, but training outside of it will have a greater impact on your overall performance. You’ll need to strategize whether to build on your strengths or address your weaknesses.  
- *Experience*: All training costs experience points, which are earned through games, quests, and events.

## **Storyline:**  
There is no fixed storyline, allowing for dynamic and randomized career progression.  
- *Branching Storylines*: Decisions you make will influence your career path. Choose to focus on endorsements, team chemistry, or personal accolades, with each choice leading to different outcomes.  
- *Random Events*: Expect a wide range of random events, including injuries, team changes, rivalries, and off-court issues that keep your career dynamic and unpredictable.

## **Quests:**  
Quests are objectives that offer rewards like coach trust, experience points, and skill boosts.  
- *Quest Variety*: Quests will vary from endorsement deals to challenges issued by your coach or teammates. They could also include rivalry matches, community outreach events, or in-game challenges.  
- *Completion Rewards*: Completing quests increases your coach's trust and provides experience points, among other perks.

## **Events:**  
Frequent events will influence your career both on and off the court.  
- *Player and Team Changes*: Roster changes, injuries, and trades can affect your role. You might also be involved in decisions, such as suggesting trades or influencing your coach to adjust the roster.  
- *Off-Court Events*: Handle press conferences, interact with fans, and navigate potential personal scandals that affect your reputation and career trajectory.
